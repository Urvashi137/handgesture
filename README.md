# handgesture
This repository contains an implementation of a robust model designed to accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

1) Dataset: The project utilizes the LeapGestRecog dataset, which includes a diverse set of hand gesture images, covering ten different gestures.
2) Data Preprocessing: Images are converted to grayscale, resized to a consistent size, and normalized to enhance model performance.
3) Model Architecture: The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, dropout layers, and dense layers, designed to effectively extract and learn features from the images.
4) Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on a large dataset and evaluated using accuracy metrics, with results visualized to provide insights into the model's performance.
5) Visualization: Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to monitor the model's learning process and performance over epochs.
